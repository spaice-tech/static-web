            The SPAICE team recently attended the highly anticipated Paris Space Week 2023, one of the most 
            significant B2B trade events dedicated to the space industry. The event was an opportunity for 
            our team to showcase our AI-based technology for autonomous space operations, spearheaded by our 
            CEO, Matteo Cuccorese, and CTO, Guillem Garrof√©.
            <br/><br/>
            Furthermore, our CEO was invited to participate in a dedicated panel on Unify Space, alongside 
            representatives from Airbus and Asitech. During this event, Matteo discussed the significance of 
            collaboration between leading companies and startups to accelerate innovation, citing our example 
            as a model.

            "The future of the space industry relies on the collaboration between 
            established companies and startups, as well as closer partnerships with academia. Startups bring 
            the agility and fresh thinking necessary to drive innovation forward, while established companies 
            provide the infrastructure and resources needed to scale and execute on new ideas."
